## Overview

This document summarizes the work completed for the CreatorDeals Supabase database setup. We've created a comprehensive database structure to support a marketplace connecting content creators with brand deals and discount codes.

## Key Components Created

### Database Tables

1. **Core Tables**
   - `brand_deals` - For storing brand collaboration opportunities
   - `discount_deals` - For storing discount code offers
   - `deal_submissions` - For managing pending deal submissions

2. **User Management**
   - `user_profiles` - Extended user information and role management
   - `user_credits` - Credit system for transactions
   - `subscriptions` - User subscription management

3. **Payment & Transaction**
   - `payment_plans` - Available credit packages
   - `payment_intents` - Payment transaction records

### Database Functions

   - `renew_subscription` - Handle renewal and credit allocation
   - `get_user_subscription_details` - Retrieve subscription details

4. **Environment Control**

### Scripts and Tools

1. **Deployment Scripts**

3. **Documentation**

## Security

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** is implemented on all tables
- Role-based access control for different user types (creators, brands, admins)
- Secure payment processing through Stripe Edge Functions

## Testing/Production Toggle

A key feature is the ability to toggle between testing and production modes:

- In testing mode, payments are simulated without actual charges
- In production mode, real payments are processed via Stripe

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**
   - Connect the frontend app to the Supabase backend using the provided functions

2. **Stripe Edge Functions**
   - Implement the Edge Functions for Stripe integration

3. **User Authentication**
   - Set up authentication flows in the frontend

4. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Create an admin interface for deal approval and user management

## Conclusion

The database setup now provides a robust foundation for the CreatorDeals platform. The structure supports all the requested features including user roles, subscription management, deal submission workflow, and the testing/production toggle for payments.
